# Origami

Given a matrix of *m x n* and a folding direction, determine what the matrix will look like when folded in the given way.\
Given four points on a piece of paper, assume the top left corner has a value of 1, and going in a clockwise direction, each corner increases in value by 1.

**Input Format**

- The first line is the number of test cases (*t*)
- The first line of each test case is the size of the matrix (*m n*)
- The second line of each test case is the folding direction from point *c* to *d*
- For the next *m* lines, each line is the row of that matrix with *n* values

**Constraints**

- 1 ≤ *c, d* ≤ 4 and *c* ≠ *d*
- 1 ≤ *m, n, t* ≤ 1,000,000
- 0 ≤ value inside the matrix (*v*) ≤ 9
- When folded, if the value of *vij* that is folded over *vi'j'* are not the same, we considered it asymmetrical (see Sample 3)
- If a side has the size of 1, we cannot fold perpendicularly to that side.

**Output Format**

For each test case, print the number of the test case starting with 1 followed by the list the resulting matrix of the folded paper. Use a hyphen symbol (-) for disappearing spaces. If the paper cannot be folded symmetrically, list "error."

**Sample Input 1**
```
1
1 1
1 2
0
```
**Sample Output 1**
```
1
error
```
**Sample Output 1 Explanation**

The matrix has size 1x1, so it's not foldable.

**Sample Input 2**
```
1
3 3
1 3
0 1 2
1 3 1
2 1 0
```
**Sample Output 2**
```
1
--2
-31
210
```
**Sample Output 2 Explanation**

If we fold it from corner 1 to corner 3, the numbers match the opposite numbers, so we can fold it symmetrically. The top left part has disappeared, so it is replaced with a hyphen symbol (-) in the output.

**Sample Input 3**
```
1
1 2
1 2
5 6
```
**Sample Output 3**
```
1
error
```
**Sample Output 3 Explanation**

We have a foldable matrix. However, when we fold from corner 1 to corner 2, the values inside the matrix are different (5 and 6), so we cannot fold it symmetrically.

**Sample Input 4**
```
1
1 3
1 2
1 2 1
```
**Sample Output 4**
```
1
-21
```
**Sample Output 4 Explanation**

The numbers match each other in the opposite side.
